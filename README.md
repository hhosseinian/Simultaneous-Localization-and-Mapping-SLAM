# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). SLAM is a fundamental technique in robotics that allows a robot to map its environment and determine its own location within that environment in real-time.

## Project Description
In this project, I have implemented SLAM for a 2-dimensional world using Python and various libraries. The project includes the following key components:
- Sensor and motion data simulation for a virtual robot.
- Real-time tracking of the robot's location.
- Landmark detection and mapping, including buildings, trees, rocks, and more.
- Integration of the Kalman Filter for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- CUDA (optional)
- Kalman Filter

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the SLAM implementation.
- `data/`: Includes sample data or datasets used for testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
- `docs/`: Documentation and project report.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run the main SLAM script to start the simulation.

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to run the project and any dependencies or libraries needed.
